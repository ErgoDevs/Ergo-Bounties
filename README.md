# Ergo Ecosystem Bounties
[Ergo Ecosystem Bounties](/bounty_issues.md) Will be posted weekly in ERG equivalent (e.g. RSN is shown in equivalent ERG while payout column notes paid in "RSN"). 
If there are bounties missing, please create a PR to add the "owner" and "repo" and they will be added next week. There should be a "Bounty" tag on the Issue as well as a value for the bounty in the same or separate tag.
