## ðŸ“š Educational Reward Program

The Educational Reward Program is designed to stimulate the creation of educational content that benefits the Ergo community. We believe in the power of knowledge-sharing and empowerment as key drivers of growth.

### Program Details

- **Focus Area**: Developer Tutorials and Guides
- **Eligibility**: Contributors of all skill levels
- **Reward**: Varies based on contribution quality and impact
- **Currency**: ERG

### How to Participate

If you have educational content, even if it's not explicitly mentioned here, it could still be eligible for a reward. We invite you to contribute any educational materials that can enrich learning experiences.

To claim a reward for your educational contribution:

1. **Complete your educational content**:
   - Create tutorials, guides, explainers, or other educational materials
   - Publish your content (on your blog, GitHub, YouTube, etc.)
   - Ensure it provides value to the Ergo community

2. **Submit a claim through this repository**:
   - Fork this repository
   - Create a new JSON file in the `submissions/` directory with the naming convention:
     ```
     {github_username}-educational-{descriptive-name}.json
     ```
   - Fill out the JSON file using the template below:
     ```json
     {
       "contributor": "your-github-username",

## About This Page

This page is organized into several sections:

1. **Current Ongoing Programs** - These are continuous reward programs without a fixed bounty amount, where rewards are determined based on the quality and impact of contributions.

   Each entry includes its current status:
   - **Open** - Available for claiming (shows a "Reserve" button)
   - **In Progress** - Already being worked on (shows "In Progress" text)

If you'd like to add a new grant or bounty to this page:

1. Fork this repository
2. Edit the `src/config/extra_bounties.json` file with the new entry
3. Include a `"status": "Open"` field (or "In Progress" if already claimed)
4. Submit a PR with the title: `[ADD MANUAL BOUNTY] Bounty Title`
